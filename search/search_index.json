The course consists of 12 lectures. We will start from basics of neural networks, introduce the loss function, optimization and how to setup and manage the training session. The next section is the convolutional neural network for imaging and vision tasks. We will learn the recurrent neural network (RNN) for the sequence data. More recently, attention mechanism and transformer models (BERT, GPT family etc.) are very popular. They are introduced after RNN. We will teach generative model and in details the GAN (generative adversarial network). The technique to visualize the neural network is introduced to help understand how and why the neural network works. The course will end with a focus on how to handle \"small dataset\" usecase, as in many practical applications, we may not be able to acquire large labelled dataset. Three techniques are introduced, transfer learning, meta learning and contrastive learning (as the more recent development of self-supervised learning). For the NHLBI DIR community, the teaching objectives are: * Introduce the basics of deep learning * Present in-math how DL model works * Provide practices to build your own model * Grow interest and improve community awareness * Prepare trainees and fellows for DL related jobs For the student point of view, you will gradually learn the concepts and algorithms behind the deep neural network and master the tools required to build and train models. For every lecture, it comes with a reading list to broaden the understanding. Assignments consist of questions and coding components and will be opened to student during teaching weeks. The focus is the understanding of basic concepts and how to design and apply deep learning to different problems. We will use Pytorch . So it is a good idea to get yourself familiar with this package . Prerequisites Please review the mathematics for deep learning and learn basic Python and Numpy. mathematics for deep learning Python, a more comprehensive book Python Crash Course, one of the easiest tutorial Numpy Pytorch tutorial Debug python program using VSCode Instructors Hui Xue, hui.xue@nih.gov David Hansen, davidchansen@gradientsoftware.net Schedule Starting on the week of Sep 13, 2021 Lecture, every Wed, 10-11:30 am, US EST time Recurrent zoom link here Q&A session, every Friday, 10-11am, US EST time Recurrent zoom link here Syllabus Prologue Why do we want to spend hours in learning deep learning (DL)? I can articulate one reason: Deep Learning is a set of key technique which can be applied to many different fields, from mobile phone to medical imaging, from robotics to online shopping, from new drug discovery to genomics. What is really amazing to me is that in this wave of technological revolution, the same set of technique, deep neural network, is solving many challenging problems which are drastically different. Yes, it is the same set of algorithms, software toolboxes and knowledge base are applied, reporting state-of-the-art performance. This makes learning deep learning rewardable, because you will master something which can be widely applied and mostly likely will stay that way in the decades to come. According to ARK's research, deep learning will add $30 trillion to the global equity market capitalization during the next 15-20 years*. No something which should be ignored! However, there are difficulties along the way. Often, more than superficial level of understanding of DL is required, if you want to find a notch to apply DL in your field and if no one has done this before you. There will not be pre-trained models which you can download. One has to understand the problem and design the model, invent new loss functions and put all pieces together to build a DL solution. Your solution needs to prove its value in deployment and gets better over time. This course is to equip you with required knowledge to understand and apply DL by teaching how the deep neural network models work and by reviewing many DL architectures and applications. My hope is after this learning process, domain experts will feel confident to apply DL to their specific problems and datasets.

It is interesting to read and compare them. Deep learning, Nature volume 521, 436\u2013444 (2015) Deep learning for all Lecture 2 This lecture introduces the concept of loss function to evaluate how well our model fits the data. The process to adjust model parameters to fit the data is called optimization. Gradient descent is a common algorithm used to optimize the model parameters, given the input dataset. This process is the training. We will review different training algorithms and introduce the concepts of training and testing. To measure our model performance in training and testing datasets, the bias and variance of model should be estimated. Other concepts introduced in this lecture include regularization, under-fitting, over-fitting, batch and mini-batch etc. Video To be added Slides PDF Download Suggested Reading Notes on optimization Loss functions in deep learning by Artem Oppermann Bias and variance Lecture 3 The key step to train a model is to follow the negative gradient direction to reduce the loss. But how do we compute the gradient direction? Through a process called the back propagation or backprop in short. This lecture discusses the backprop in detail. Backprop is based on two ideas: chain rule of derivative and divide-and-conquer. It allows us to compute complex derivative from loss to every learnable parameters in the model. We will not review GPU devices for deep learning in lectures. Please review two documents in this week's reading list.

We will introduce a few new methods and compare their pros and cons. The concept of hyper-parameter is explained, where a very important one is the learning rate. Different learning rate scheduling strategies are discussed in this lecture and help boost training performance. To search a good configuration of hyper-parameters, we will discuss coarse-to-fine, hyper-band and Bayesian methods.

We start by discussing the differences and links between generative and discriminative models. Then the G/D design of generative adversarial model is introduced. The GAN loss is analyzed in detail and its optimal solution is derived. Examples are presented for the significant progress in GAN framework.

Shortly after the take-off of deep NN in 2021, people found these models can be fooled by images looking normal to human eyes, while models will misclassified them with very high confidence. These examples are called adversarial examples. The cause for this phenomenon is discussed in the lecture with methods to generate adversarial examples and how to defend it. Understanding what models learned can help, which leads to techniques for model visualization. In the second part of lecture, different model visualization methods are reviewed, including occlusion, saliency maps, Grad-CAM and guided backprop.

What if we only have a small amount of labelled data or a lot of data without labelling? This lecture introduces some techniques for these more realistic scenario, including transfer learning, meta learning and contrastive learning. The algorithms and utilities of these methods are discussed with real-world examples. The contrastive learning, as the latest development in self-supervised learning, is of particular interests to enable the usage of large unlabeled data. The lecture introduces SimCLR and MoCo algorithms and discusses the contrastive learning as the backbone for multi-modality usecases.

In this closing remark, we step back to take a bird-eye view of what we had learned. The big picture is DL is becoming an essential technology to create substantial value to the society for the decade to come. To achieve this potential, the machine learning system and effective development/deployment iteration are more important, leading to the rise of MLOps. As domain experts, adding DL to your expertise is a good way to get started. For many of us, it may be the only feasible way. So some more resources are provided for continuous learning.

These examples are called adversarial examples. The cause for this phenomenon is discussed in the lecture with methods to generate adversarial examples and how to defend it. Understanding what models learned can help, which leads to techniques for model visualization. In the second part of lecture, different model visualization methods are reviewed, including occlusion, saliency maps, Grad-CAM and guided backprop.","title":"Lecture 11"},{"location":"nhlbi2021/#video_11","text":"To be added","title":"Video"},{"location":"nhlbi2021/#slides_11","text":"PDF Download","title":"Slides"},{"location":"nhlbi2021/#suggested-reading_11","text":"Adversarial examples Adversarial machine learning Visualization of deep NN Grad Cam","title":"Suggested Reading"},{"location":"nhlbi2021/#lecture-12","text":"Deep learning works great if we have large amount of clean, diverse and labelled data. What if we only have a small amount of labelled data or a lot of data without labelling? This lecture introduces some techniques for these more realistic scenario, including transfer learning, meta learning and contrastive learning. The algorithms and utilities of these methods are discussed with real-world examples. The contrastive learning, as the latest development in self-supervised learning, is of particular interests to enable the usage of large unlabeled data. The lecture introduces SimCLR and MoCo algorithms and discusses the contrastive learning as the backbone for multi-modality usecases.","title":"Lecture 12"},{"location":"nhlbi2021/#video_12","text":"To be added","title":"Video"},{"location":"nhlbi2021/#slides_12","text":"PDF Download","title":"Slides"},{"location":"nhlbi2021/#suggested-reading_12","text":"Self-supervised learning Learn to learn, Lil'Log Self-Supervised Representation Learning, Lil'Log MAML SimCLR, a fun paper to read SimCLR v2","title":"Suggested Reading"},{"location":"nhlbi2021/#closing-remarks","text":"During this course, we learned many deep learning models and algorithms, and gained mindsets to work with DL. In this closing remark, we step back to take a bird-eye view of what we had learned. The big picture is DL is becoming an essential technology to create substantial value to the society for the decade to come. To achieve this potential, the machine learning system and effective development/deployment iteration are more important, leading to the rise of MLOps. As domain experts, adding DL to your expertise is a good way to get started. For many of us, it may be the only feasible way. So some more resources are provided for continuous learning.","title":"Closing remarks"},{"location":"nhlbi2021/#suggested-reading_13","text":"Machine Learning System Design MLOps An insightful post for future of AI society Moore's Law for Everything","title":"Suggested Reading"}]}
