# NHLBI, 2021 Fall

This offering is for Division of Intramural (DIR), NHLBI in Fall, 2021. The course consists of 12 lectures. We will start from basics of neural networks, introduce the loss function, optimization and how to setup and manage the training session. The next section is the convolutional neural network for imaging and vision tasks. We will learn the recurrent neural network (RNN) for the sequence data. More recently, attention mechanism and transformer models (BERT, GPT family etc.) are very popular. They are introduced after RNN. We will teach generative model and in details the GAN (generative adversarial network). The technique to visualize the neural network is introduced to help understand how and why the neural network works. The course will end with a focus on how to handle "small dataset" usecase, as in many practical applications, we may not be able to acquire large labelled dataset. Three techniques are introduced, transfer learning, meta learning and contrastive learning (as the more recent development of self-supervised learning).

For the NHLBI DIR community, the teaching objectives are:

    * Introduce the basics of deep learning
    * Present in-math how DL model works
    * Provide practices to build your own model
    * Grow interest and improve community awareness
    * Prepare trainees and fellows for DL related jobs

For the student point of view, you will gradually learn the concepts and algorithms behind the deep neural network and master the tools required to build and train models. For every lecture, it comes with a reading list to broaden the understanding. 

Assignments consist of questions and coding components and will be opened to student during teaching weeks. The focus is the understanding of basic concepts and how to design and apply deep learning to  different problems. 

We will use [Pytorch](www.pytorch.org). So it is a good idea to get yourself familiar with this [package](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).

## Course projects

The course project is a great opportunity to apply deep learning to a problem of your interests. Given the very diverse background of course participants, it is of interests to see what deep learning may do in your domain. 

I would encourage you to think about a few ideas about how to apply DL to a problem in your domain. To get started, try to ask questions such as:

- Do I have a clear goal for what the model should do? E.g. segment a specific vessel and measure its diameter, or predict the outcome for a certain patient cohort, or improve imaging signal-noise-ratio or reduce radiation dose.

- Do I have data available, or whether I can start collecting data? Maybe data is generated in your workflow, but not saved. There are also openly available datasets.

- Is there a clear way to label the data? Maybe it is hard to come out a good data labelling strategy at the beginning. But can you get started and refine the data labelling after gaining more experience?

- How will you design the loss function and what is a possible model architecture? For these technical questions, there may be publications using deep learning for your domain. It is a good idea to review some papers to see how others formatted the problem.

- After building the model, will it be useful to improve your workflow or even become a *deployed* component? For example, a model to improve imaging SNR can be deployed and used regularly in experiments. If so, you will have a way to continuously adding new data to your dataset.

You can work in a team of up to 3 people. You can consult any resources (e.g. github repo, books, papers, code by others etc.). But you are expected to collect, label/clean datasets, design and implement model, conduct the training, validating the model. In short, you are expected to **drive a deep learning project**. 

The course projects consist of three stages: proposal, milestone and final report. 

- **Proposal** should be no more than one page. Try to state clearly about: what is the problem you are trying to solve with DL? What dataset will you use? If you are going to collect data, what is the strategy and timeline to curate a dataset? Ideas about model design and training. Finally, you should anticipate the expected outcome.

- **Milestone** should be no more than 3 pages, including: Introduction, Method, Dataset, Preliminary results and Discussion. You should clearly state the problem, technical route and possible further improvement.

- **Final report** should be up to 5 pages, including, Introduction, Related work if any, Method, Dataset, Training details, Results, Model deployment if applicable, Discussion, and Conclusion. Consider this final report to be the fist draft of your deep learning paper submitted to a good journal in your domain! 

## Syllabus

### **Prologue**

![L0 Intro](images/lectures/L0.png)

**Why do we want to spend hours in learning deep learning (DL)?** 
I can articulate one reason: Deep Learning is a set of key technique which can be applied to many fields, from mobile phone to medical imaging, from robotics to online shopping, from new drug discovery to genomics. What is really amazing to me is that in this wave of technological revolution, the **same** set of technique, deep neural network, is solving many challenging problems which are drastically different. Yes, it is the same set of algorithms, software toolboxes and knowledge base are applied, reporting state-of-the-art performance.

This makes learning deep learning rewardable, because you will master something which can be widely applied and mostly likely will stay that way in the decades to come. According to ARK's research, deep learning will add $30 trillion to the global equity market capitalization during the next 15-20 years*. No something which should be ignored!

However, there are difficulties along the way. Often, more than superficial level of understanding of DL is required, if you want to find a notch to apply DL in your field and if no one has done this before you. There will not be pre-trained models which you can download. One has to understand the problem and design the model, invent new loss functions and put all pieces together to build a DL solution. Your solution needs to prove its value in deployment and gets better over time.

This course is to equip you with required knowledge to understand and apply DL by teaching how the deep neural network models work and by reviewing many DL architectures and applications. My hope is after this learning process, domain experts will feel confident to apply DL to their specific problems and datasets.

### **Lecture 2**

![L2 Intro](images/lectures/L2.png)

This lecture introduces the concept of loss function to evaluate how well our model fits the data. The process to adjust model parameters to fit the data is called optimization. Gradient descent is a common algorithm used to optimize the model parameters, given the input dataset. This process is the training. We will review different training algorithms and introduce the concepts of training and testing. To measure our model performance in training and testing datasets, the bias and variance of model should be estimated. Other concepts introduced in this lecture include regularization, under-fitting, over-fitting, batch and mini-batch etc.

### **Lecture 3**

![L3 Intro](images/lectures/L3.png)

The key step to train a model is to follow the negative gradient direction to reduce the loss. But how do we compute the gradient direction? Through a process called the back propagation or backprop in short. This lecture discusses the backprop in detail. Backprop is based on two ideas: chain rule of derivative and divide-and-conquer. It allows us to compute complex derivative from loss to every learnable parameters in the model. 

We will not review GPU devices for deep learning in lectures. Please review two documents in this week's reading list.

### **Assignment 1**

[Download the Assignment 1](https://gadgetrondata.blob.core.windows.net/dlcc/dlcc_assignment1.zip)

In this assignment, you will be asked to implement the multi-layer perceptron model and cross-entropy loss. The coding problem will require the implementation for both forward pass and backprop. The gradient descent is used to train the model for higher classification accuracy. We will not use deep learning framework in this assignment, but will use Python+Numpy combination. The goal is to make sure the thorough understanding of mathematics and numeric technique necessary for a classic neural network. Also, it is to encourage one to get familiar with python coding.

This assignment introduces the regression test for model training and evaluation. The [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) is used for the regression test purpose.

### **Lecture 4**

![L4 Intro](images/lectures/L4.png)

This lecture will finish our discussion on different optimization algorithms. We will introduce a few new methods and compare their pros and cons. The concept of hyper-parameter is explained, where a very important one is the learning rate. Different learning rate scheduling strategies are discussed in this lecture and help boost training performance. To search a good configuration of hyper-parameters, we will discuss coarse-to-fine, hyper-band and Bayesian methods. We close the lecture by discussing bag of tricks to set up the training process and cross-validation.

### **Lecture 11**

![L11 Intro](images/lectures/L11.png)

This lecture discusses two related topics in deep learning: adversarial examples and deep NN visualization. Shortly after the take-off of deep NN in 2021, people found these models can be fooled by images looking normal to human eyes, while models will misclassified them with very high confidence. These examples are called adversarial examples. The cause for this phenomenon is discussed in the lecture with methods to generate adversarial examples and how to defend it. Understanding what models learned can help, which leads to techniques for model visualization. In the second part of lecture, different model visualization methods are reviewed, including occlusion, saliency maps, Grad-CAM and guided backprop.

### **Lecture 12**

![L12 Intro](images/lectures/L12.png)

Deep learning works great if we have large amount of clean, diverse and labelled data. What if we only have a small amount of labelled data or a lot of data without labelling? This lecture introduces some techniques for these more realistic scenario, including transfer learning, meta learning and contrastive learning. The algorithms and utilities of these methods are discussed with real-world examples. The contrastive learning, as the latest development in self-supervised learning, is of particular interests to enable the usage of large unlabeled data. The lecture introduces SimCLR and MoCo algorithms and discusses the contrastive learning as the backbone for multi-modality usecases.

### **Closing remarks**

![L13 Intro](images/lectures/closing_remarks.png)

During this course, we learned many deep learning models and algorithms, and gained mindsets to work with DL. In this closing remark, we step back to take a bird-eye view of what we had learned. The big picture is DL is becoming an essential technology to create substantial value to the society for the decade to come. To achieve this potential, the machine learning system and effective development/deployment iteration are more important, leading to the rise of MLOps. As domain experts, adding DL to your expertise is a good way to get started. For many of us, it may be the only feasible way. So some more resources are provided for continuous learning.
